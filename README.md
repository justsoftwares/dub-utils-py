# About

This program now can get information about actors
from ass files and by GUI two lists you can put
any actors specially for any dubbers 
(or just any special key).

I am plan to add functional for adding accents in
the ass for correct pronunciations by dubbers.

[releases](https://github.com/justsoftwares/subtitles-utils-py/releases) page
